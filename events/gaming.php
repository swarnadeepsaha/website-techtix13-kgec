                                  <p>1) the players must kick-off with a backward pass at the beginning of each half and after every goal is                                                scored.<br/>
                                   <p>2) the players are not allowed to shoot the ball directly onto the crossbar from a corner kick in order to                                              get a chance for a header when the ball rebounds.<br/>
                                  <p>3) it is not allowed to score a goal from one’s own half of the field.<br/>
                                  <p>4) it is forbidden to make a throw-in directly into the opponent's penalty area. Should a player throw the ball directly into the opponent's penalty area he shall be warned. Should he persist, he shall be disqualified from the tournament. Any goals resulting from a throw-in into the opponent's penalty area will not be counted.<br/>
                                 <p>5) if a player changes his tactics, formation or line-up he has to kick the ball out of bounds after the changes so that his opponent is able to react.<br/>
                                  <p>6) if a player is found to be intentionally delaying the game time by passing the ball around and clearly not attempting to score, he may be given a warning or lose by default at the referee's discretion<br/>
                                  <p>7) prior to making any changes to one’s team, the player that wants to make a change must be in possession of the ball and be in his own half before he pauses the game. In the last few minutes of the game it is not allowed to make any changes to one’s team with the sole intent of delaying the match. Should this be the case, the player delaying the match will be warned by a referee and, should he persist after the warning, be attributed with a default loss of the match.<br/>
                                   <p>8) there is a bug in FIFA 8 where the ball sometimes enters the goal from the top of the crossbar or from the top or side of the net, and FIFA 8(PC) considers it a goal. Should such bug occur during a match, the player should take note and, at the end of the match, call a referee to confirm the bug with the use of the in-game replay. Should this bug be confirmed, it will be removed from the final score. </br>
<p>Here are two examples of such a bug:</br>

                                   <p>9) “Long balls” (Q+A, Q+W, etc…) are allowed in specific cases.
To understand when a long ball is allowed or not, have a look at the following image:
Long balls are allowed when done from inside the green area or when you are in your own half of the field.
Long balls are forbidden when taken from one’s yellow/blue area and are directed into the opponent’s yellow/blue area.

                                   <p>In any case, a goal scored due to the use of a “forbidden move” shall not be counted.<br/>
                              <p>Should a player persist in playing with forbidden moves, he may be disqualified from the tournament.<br/>
                               <p>All complaints shall be dealt with after the match has been completed.<br/>

                              <p>any connection loss between opponents due to system, network, PC, and/or power problems/issues.<br/>
                               <p>Intentional disconnection: any connection loss between opponents due to a player’s actions. Upon judgment by the                                     referee, the offending player may be charged with a default loss.<br/>
                              <p>Should a disconnection occur:<br/>
                               <p>1) A referee will confirm the exact score to that point (even if the ball is about to cross the goal line, the                                        goal shall not count), and restart the match.<br/>
                              <p>2) A referee will inform the players on exactly how many minutes must still be played in order to complete the match<br/>
                               <p>3) Any players sent off the field (red card) shall count as a goal each for the opponent when the match resumes.<br/>
                              <p>4) If the disconnection occurs after a corner kick was awarded to a player, the match will resume with a corner kick for that same player.
