                                <p>Your aim in this event is to make an autonomous line tracing robot that will detect boom barrier and stop until it is not removed. Each team will comprise of maximum 5 members .Winner will be decided on the basis of timing, accuracy and points.<br/>
</p>

                                <p><h2 style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size:20px;">Problem Statement & Specification:</h2></p>
                                <P>Make an Autonomous line following robot to trace black line of 4 cm width (background will be white). Robot should detect boom barrier of white colour and wait until boom barrier is not removed.<br/>

							   2.Track contains several curves (like circular, sharp 90 degrees etc.) and one or more boom barriers.<br/>
							   3.There will be crossing lines near boom barrier at a certain distance (10 cm approx.) from barriers, if a bot crosses these lines or touches boom barriers will lose valuable points.<br/>
							   4.Breadth of boom barrier (white colour) will be 6 cm .lower edge of barriers will be at a height of 6 cm from ground.<br/>
							   5.Initially the boom barrier is kept down, after detecting it bot will stop and wait until the barrier is removed automatically after few second.<br/>

                               1."200" Negative marks for restart in case of the derailment of the bot.<br/>
							   2."500" points will be deducted if someone touches the in run without prior permission of the bot.<br/>
							   3."100" marks for reset from 1<sup>st</sup> checkpoint, "200" for 2<sup>nd</sup> checkpoint and "300" for last checkpoint. <br/>
							   4."200" bonus marks will be awarded if the bot will stop at the END point.</br> 
							   5. If the bot touches the Boom Barrier penalty of 'average distance' will be considered as <b>distance to stop</b> from the boom barrier and the bot must reset from last checkpoint.<br/>
5.If the bot make a serious <b>HIT</b> in the Boom Barrier the specific lap will be for the bot will be end there.</br>
							   6.The team will be disqualified for damage of the arena and the boom barrier.<br/>

                                <p><h2 style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size:20px;">INTRODUCTION:</h2></p>
                                <p>Violence has always been an integral part of the human society. There has always been a burning urge to show dominance. With the advent of technological advancement, that need has only gotten bigger.
To suffice that need, KGEC calls everyone to arms with your bot by your side. Come to witness the thwak, thunk, metal on metal carnage. Cut, hammer, break, crash, push, destroy, trash, dismantle, smash, axe, nuke, suppress, tear apart, annihilate…. but that’s just the beginning. Time has proved it is just not an individual’s might that can alone win wars as they say “Battles are won by both slaughter and maneuver”.
Be ready this time to face new and surprising challenges, but with determination, strength and careful strategy one can overcome any hurdles and survive this one on one showdown.
Come witness and be a part of this high adrenaline event, this season in TECHTIX 2K13.

POINT DETAILS
</h2></p>
<p>
  Pushing out the opponent bot out of the arena = 100<br/>
  Each checkpoint = 75<br/>
  Immobilisng the opponent bot = 100<br/>
